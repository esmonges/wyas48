Parsing:
2.Add support for vectors. The Haskell representation is up to you: GHC does have an Array data type, but it can be difficult to use. Strictly speaking, a vector should have constant-time indexing and updating, but destructive update in a purely functional language is difficult. You may have a better idea how to do this after the section on set!, later in this tutorial.
Instead of using the try combinator, left-factor the grammar so that the common subsequence is its own parser.3.You should end up with a parser that matches a string of expressions, and one that matches either nothing or a dot and a single expressions. Combining the return values of these into either a List or a DottedList is left as a (somewhat tricky) exercise for the reader: you may want to break it out into another helper function.

TODO:
EX for section 3. You can definitely do these without looking at answers.
